# there is the reference function func that provides the exact solution. The reference solution can be a data cloud.(See Lorenz example)

Questions:
1. How do the loss function works?
    - The string loss is given during the compiling
    - The loss is converted to a function "loss_fn" by losses_model.get(loss), such as MSE.
    - In the traning and testing phase, the output_losses is called and losses method is assigned to losses_fn, the output_losses is computed.
2. why the in the dataclass a tuple is defined?


DEBUG:
1. .. means the folder in the higher level. For example, ../data.py means find the file data.py in the parent folder.
2. __init__ outside a class. the file is package maker and in charge of import management.


PROGRAMMING:
1. map(function, iterable) function: iterate over the iterable and apply the function to each item. The return is a map object.

2. list(map(function, iterable)) convert the map object to a list.
To access the items in the map object, you need to convert it to a list first: 
x = self.activation[0](linear(x))  # Error! Can't index map object

3. The double interation: 


pytorch:
1. nn.ModuleList() is a container that holds a list of modules. It is used to store a list of modules that are to be applied to each input element.
2. nn.Model(x): The __call__ method (which allows using net(inputs)) - also inherited from nn.Module
